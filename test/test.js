// // Code problem:

// I am trying to run all my tests from a single file (test.js)

// However, when I run the following test:
// console.log(`queenRoom6 should have a roomId of 6: ${queenRoom6.roomId === 6 ? chalk.green('✓') : chalk.red('✗')}`)

// It doesn't work. It doesn't print on the terminal
