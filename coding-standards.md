## Principles to keep in mind

- **Separation of Concerns** (Each function should do one thing)

- **Avoid Premature Optimization** (Don't optimize code until it's necessary)

- **Rule of Three** (If you use the same code in three places, it shouldbe refactored into a function)

- **DRY:** Don't Repeat Yourself (Avoid duplicating code)

- **KISS:** - Keep It Stupid Simple (Don't overcomplicate code)

- **YAGNI:** - You Aren't Gonna Need It (Don't add functionality until it's necessary to avoid bloated code)
