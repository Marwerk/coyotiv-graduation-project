## Coyotiv Coding Standards

# Principles to keep in mind

**Separation of Concerns**
**Avoid Premature Optimization** (Don't optimize code until it's cessary)
**DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself (Avoid duplicating code)

- **Rule of Three** (If you use the same code in three places, it shouldbe refactored into a function)
  **KISS** - Keep It Stupid Simple (or Keep It Simple, Stupid)
  **YAGNI** - You Aren't Gonna Need It (Don't add functionality until it's cessary to avoid bloated code)

# Naming Guidelines

- functionNamesLikeThis
- variableNamesLikeThis
- ClassNamesLikeThis
- EnumNamesLikeThis
- methodNamesLikeThis
- CONSTANT_VALUES_LIKE_THIS
- file-names-like-this.js

Name elements in your code clearly and concisely
Don't use abbreviations unless they are very common (e.g. 'url')
Pay attention to casing for different names: camelCase, kebab-case, PascalCase
Use numbers appropriately (e.g. ISO9000)

### Commits
