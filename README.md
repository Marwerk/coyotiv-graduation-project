## "Las Calas" Apart-Hotel Website Revamp

---

## 1. Introduction

The goal is to create a website for a small but charming apart-hotel that serves as a portal for prospective guests and provides an easy-to-use system for booking inquiries

## 2. Objectives

- Provide a comprehensive, user-friendly platform for prospective guests to discover the unique cultural and aesthetic appeal of Las Calas.
- Streamline the booking process, providing clear and transparent information on room availability, rates, and amenities.
- Showcase the strategic location benefits to prospective guests - namely, proximity to economic hubs, a large university, and a major hospital.
- Enhance our guests' experience with digital customer service and support, both before and during their stay.

## 3. Target

The focus is on individuals who value personalized service, appreciate unique cultural aesthetics, and require (ideally, but not limited-to) long-term stay options near strategic city locations. The website is also an opportunity to attract those who may value the home-like ambiance, the sense of community, and the cultural narrative that Las Calas has to offer.
